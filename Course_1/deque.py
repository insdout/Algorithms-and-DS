# Deque (double-ended queue) is an abstract data structure with the following operation
#
# -push_front adds a key to the head of the deque
# -push_back adds a key to the tail of the deque
# -pop_front extracts a key from the head of the deque and returns it
# -pop_back extracts a key from the tail of the deque and returns it
# -front returns head element without removing it
# -back returns tail element without removing it
# -size returns number of the elements in the deque
# -clear removes all elements from the deque
#
# Implement DequeDeque class with this methods and error handling.
# For pop_front, pop_back, front, back
# the method has to check are there elements in the deque.
# If it is empty the method has to return string "error" instead of a numeric value.
#
# push_front, push_back, clear methods has to return string "ok".
#
# Implement process_deque(commands) which takes commands list and returns a list of answers to each command.
#
# Input data:
# List commands consisting of strings "push_front x", "push_back x", "pop_front",
# "pop_back", "front", "back", "size", "clear".
#
# len(commands)â‰¤60000
#
# Output data:
# A list of answers for each command
# Example:
#
# Input: Input:
#
#commands=["push_front 1","push_front 2","push_back 6","front","back","clear","size","back"]
# Output: ["ok", "ok", "ok",  2, 6, "ok", 0, "error"]
