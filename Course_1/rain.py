# A landscape in a Flat World consists of blocks size 1 by 1 meter.
# The island is a set of different height columns consist of stone and surrounded by the sea.
# Heavy rain have fallen over the island, and filled all the lowlands with water. Extra water
# has gone back into the sea, without increasing its level. According to the landscape of the
# island, determine how many blocks of water remain after rain in the lowlands on the island.
#
# Implement a function calc_rain_water(h) which takes the landscape of the island and returns
# the number of remaining water blocks.
#
# Input data:
# List hh consisting of integers, each number corresponds to island column height,
# len(h) ≤100000,  h_i  1 ≤ h ≤10^9.
#
# Output data:
# One integer — remaining water blocks number.
# Example:
#
# Input: h = [2, 5, 2, 3, 6, 9, 1, 3, 4, 6, 1]
#
# Output: 15
# To satisfy time limit for this task your solution has to work for O(n).
# Try to use the same approach with stack like in Maximum rectangle in a histogram task.
