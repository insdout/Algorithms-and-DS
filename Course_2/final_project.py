# You are tasked with developing a movie recommendation system.
# You are given a list of movies (their names) and a list of similarities between movies
# (pairs of movies that are similar). You are also given a list of user's friends,
# and for each friend a list of movies that he has already seen.
#
# Your system should recommend one movie with the highest discussability and uniqueness.
# Discussability is the number of friends of user, who have already seen that movie.
# Uniqueness is 1 divided by the mean number of similar movies that user's friends have already seen.
# So you should return the film with the highest number: F / S,
# where F = number of friends who have seen this movie,
# and S = mean of number of similar movies seen for each friend.
# Exclude the movies with S = 0.
#
# If (a, b) and (b, c) are pairs of similar movies, then (a, c) is a pair of similar movies too.
# Each movie is not counted in its Uniqueness.
#
# Input example.
# Basically it is up to you to come up with data structure you like or you think easy to work with.
# In a nutshell you have as an input these parameters (they can be in form of a list/dict etc):
#
# With discussability it is easy.
# Discussability is the number of friends of user, who have already seen that movie. We will have:
#
#     Joker - 4
#     1917 - 2
#     Parasite - 1
#     Jojo Rabbit - 1
#     Ford v Ferrari - 0
#
# Now let's go with uniqueness. Uniqueness is 1 divided by the mean number of similar movies
# that the user's friends have already seen. Similar movies have transitive property:
# if movie 1 is similar to movie 2 and movie 2 is similar to movie 3 -> movie 1 is similar to movie 3 and vice versa.
#
# Let's breakdown how many similar movies each movie has:
#
#     Joker - 1 (Ford v Ferrari)
#     1917 - 2 (Parasite, Jojo Rabbit)
#     Parasite - 2 (1917, Jojo Rabbit)
#     Jojo Rabbit - 2 (Parasite, 1917)
#     Ford v Ferrari - 1 (Joker)
#
# Okay, let's count for each movie how many friends seen similar movies.
#
#     Joker - 0 (None saw Ford v Ferrari)
#     1917 - 1 (Parasite), 1 (Jojo Rabbit)
#     Parasite - 2 (1917) , 1 (Jojo Rabbit)
#     Jojo Rabbit - 1 (Parasite), 2 (1917)
#     Ford v Ferrari - 4 (Joker)
#
#  Let's find mean values:
#
#     Joker - mean(0) = 0
#     1917 - mean(1,1) = 1
#     Parasite - mean(2 ,1) = 1.5
#     Jojo Rabbit - mean(1,2) = 1.5
#     Ford v Ferrari - mean(4) = 4
#
# In the end we need to return movie with highest score which is calculated like this: F/S,
# where F = number of friends who have seen this movie (discussability),
# and S = mean of the number of similar movies seen for each friend (uniqueness).
# Let's find out what movie should we recommend:
#
#     Joker - 4/0 = 0
#     1917 - 2/1 = 2
#     Parasite - 1/1.5 = 0.66666
#     Jojo Rabbit - 1/1.5 = 0.66666
#     Ford v Ferrari - 0/4 = 0
