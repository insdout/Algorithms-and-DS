# Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent strings.
#
# Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency
# by their lexicographical order.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
# Output: ["i","love"]
# Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
# Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.

# Runtime: 51 ms, faster than 97.76% of Python3 online submissions for Top K Frequent Words.
# Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 68.17% of Python3 online submissions for Top K Frequent Words.
